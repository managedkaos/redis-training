<h1>Hands-On Session: Hello Redis</h1>
<p>This directory contains files to use for the first hands-on exercise, building the classic
  Hello World with a Redis twist. In this session, you will create a Hello Redis program
  which connects to Redis, writes a message to the database, reads that message back, then
  displays the message to the end user. After that you will modify the program to add a
  counter to track the number of times the program executes.</p>
<p>The files <code>hello_redis.py</code> is a skeleton program to get you started. It provides and explains
  the boilerplate code needed to set up a connection to Redis. If you get stuck <code>hello_redis_solution.py</code>
  implements a solution to the exercise. Feel free to study it or get help from the training staff.</p>
<p>Although this is a hands-on exercise, we want to encourage you to use this time to ask
  questions of the training staff as well.</p>
<h2>Part One: Hello Redis</h2>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Prior to modifying <code>hello_redis.py</code>, run the program and see what happens</li>
  <li>Add code to the program to store a Hello World message in Redis</li>
  <li>Modify the code that prints the message to read the message from Redis instead of a constant string</li>
</ol>
<h3>Further Activities</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Do you understand what the function of the <code>decode_response</code> flag?</li>
  <li>Try running the program with <code>decode_response=false</code>. What happens?</li>
</ol>
<h2>Part Two:</h2>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Add code to <code>hello_redis.py</code> to track how often the program runs</li>
  <li>Uncomment the code to print the run count message and modify to use the value from Redis</li>
</ol>
<h3>Further Activities</h3>
<ol>
  <li>What happens if you and a classmate run your programs against the same database concurrently? Do you see any
    problems?</li>
  <li>Compare your solution with ours. What differences, if any, do you notice? Are they meaningful?</li>
</ol>
<h2>Part Three (Optional): Try Hello Redis in another language</h2>
<p>Included in this zip is the <code>node</code> directory that has the same set of exercises as Python but in Node.js.
  Take a look at this directory and try running the same exercise in Node. Examine the code to see the similarities and
  differences.</p>
<p>If you are familiar with other languages, try to build this same exercise in the language of your choice.</p>
