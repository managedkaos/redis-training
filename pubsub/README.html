<h1>Hands-On Session: PubSub</h1>
<p>This exercise demonstrates the PubSub features of Redis by building a simulation of JSON messages
  being sent from publishers to subscribers in response to events happening on a website. For this
  session, you will need to review the Redis PubSub commands, create a publisher that publishes JSON events
  via Redis, then create a set of subscribers to receive and process the events.</p>
<p>This directory contains files to use for the exercise. The <code>publish.py</code>/<code>subscribe.py</code>
  programs provides a skeleton to
  help you get started. We have added code to manage multiple publishers and subscribers running locally
  and to help create simulated messages. If you get stuck, files ending with <code>_solution.py</code> implements our
  solution to
  the exercise. Feel free to study it or ask questions of the training staff.</p>
<p>Although this is a hands-on exercise, we want to encourage you to use this time to ask
  questions of the training staff as well.</p>
<h2>Part One: Review PubSub Documentation on redis.io</h2>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>Please review the following documentation on redis.io to get started:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://redis.io/commands#pubsub">PubSub Commands</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py">Python client API</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Part Two: Create a Publisher</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Prior to modifying <code>publish.py</code>, run the program and see what happens</li>
  <li>Update the file with your connection information</li>
  <li>Add code to create a Redis connection object</li>
  <li>Add code to the event simulation loop to publish the events via Redis</li>
  <li>Add code to send the terminate event to the subscribers</li>
</ol>
<h3>Further Activities</h3>
<ol>
  <li>What happens to the messages since there are no subscribers?</li>
  <li>How can you test this code without the subscriber code?</li>
</ol>
<h2>Part Three: Create a Subscriber</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Prior to modifying <code>subscribe.py</code>, run the program and see what happens</li>
  <li>Update the file with your connection information</li>
  <li>Add code to create a Redis connection object</li>
  <li>Add code to subscribe to the appropriate channels</li>
  <li>Add code to get the JSON message from the Redis subscription</li>
  <li>Run the script in a different window from the Publisher code</li>
</ol>
<h3>Further Activities</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Why do you think we have a separate publish and subscribe program?</li>
  <li>How can you test this code without the publisher code?</li>
</ol>
